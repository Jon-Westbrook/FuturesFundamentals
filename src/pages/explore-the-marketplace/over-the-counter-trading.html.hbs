        <p>Itâ€™s hard to talk about <em class="glossary__term">futures</em> without mentioning <em class="glossary__term" data-term="option">options</em> over-the-counter <em class="glossary__term" data-term="contract">contracts</em>, particularly those in the interest rate, foreign exchange and <em class="glossary__term" data-term="commodity">commodities</em> markets. Over-the-counter, or OTC, trades are those that take place between a buyer and a seller outside of a formal exchange.</p>
        <p><em class="glossary__term" data-term="over-the-counter derivative">OTC derivatives</em> let traders go beyond standardized futures products and customize the terms of the contracts they trade. Usually, the traders work through a network of dealers who negotiate these agreements on a one-to-one basis. Though it offers greater freedom and potentially lower trading costs, <em class="glossary__term" data-term="over-the-counter trading">OTC trading</em> may leave both parties at risk for <em class="glossary__term" data-term="counterparty">counterparty</em> default if they are not using the services of a <em class="glossary__term">clearing house</em>.</p>
